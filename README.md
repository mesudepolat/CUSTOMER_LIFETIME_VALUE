## How to Calculate Customer Lifetime Value?

* CLTV = (Customer_Value / Churn_Rate) x Profit_margin
* Customer_Value = Average_Order_Value * Purchase_Frequency
* Average_Order_Value = Total_Revenue / Total_Number_of_Orders
* Purchase_Frequency =  Total_Number_of_Orders / Total_Number_of_Customers
* Churn_Rate = 1 - Repeat_Rate
* Profit_margin
