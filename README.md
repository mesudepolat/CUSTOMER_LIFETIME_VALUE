# CUSTOMER_LIFETIME_VALUE

Customer lifetime value for a firm is the net profit or loss to the firm from a customer over the entire life of transactions of that customer with the firm


## Project Steps

*  Calculation of the expected number of selling number in a specific time period by using BG/NBD.
* Calculation of the expected average profit with Gamma Gamma modeling.
* By combining them we get the CLTV.


## How to Calculate Customer Lifetime Value?

* CLTV = (Customer_Value / Churn_Rate) x Profit_margin
* Customer_Value = Average_Order_Value * Purchase_Frequency
* Average_Order_Value = Total_Revenue / Total_Number_of_Orders
* Purchase_Frequency =  Total_Number_of_Orders / Total_Number_of_Customers
* Churn_Rate = 1 - Repeat_Rate
* Profit_margin
